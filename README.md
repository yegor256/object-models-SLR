This is the data we collected while doing Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
of object models.

The input data are in three files, by the names of the source they came from:
`ScienceDirect.csv`, `IEEE.csv`, and `ACM.csv`. These CSV files contain
full lists of papers we found by using search.

The `feature-extraction.xlsx` explains how we identified the presence
of certain OO features in the models under analysis.

The `Decisions.csv` summarizes the decisions we made for each paper
papers (three people were participating).

The `Selected.csv` lists the papers we selected.
